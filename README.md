# NodeJS-Project
So, this is a basic nodeJS application using the handlebars and mongoDB cloud atlas and other security features like authentication using JWTTOKEN and cookie-parser.
index.js is the main file which you need to run using nodemon in order to walk through the whole app.
But before running the index.js file, try installing all the required dependencies in the powershell node modules like express, cors, express-handlebars, 
mongoose and authentication dependencies.
